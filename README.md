# Brickwork
-> Given the explanation of the assignment (even n, m or rows, columns)
  -> There always will be a valid solution
  -> There always will be more than one solution (at least 2)

-> "Add comments on each class, method, and instantiated variable."
  -> Most of the code is self-explanatory. I have added all the necessary comments 
     but all that comments make the code far less readable than without comments
